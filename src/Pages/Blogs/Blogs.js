                    <p>There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps:

                        <li> Local state</li>
                        <li> Global state</li>
                        <li> Server state</li>
                        <li> URL state</li>

                    <p>The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.</p>

                    <p>A unit test is a type of software test that focuses on components of a software product. The purpose is to ensure that each unit of
                        software code works as expected. A unit can be a function, method, module, object, or other entity in an applicationâ€™s source code. <br />
                        Unit testing ensures that all code meets quality standards before it's deployed. This ensures a reliable engineering environment where quality is paramount. Over the course of the product development life cycle, unit testing saves time and money, and helps developers write better code, more efficiently.

                    <p>Vue provides higher customizability and hence is easier to learn than Angular or React. Further, Vue has an overlap with Angular and React with respect to their functionality like the use of components. Hence, the transition to Vue from either of the two is an easy option.</p>
